In those cases, failures can be extracted from the maintenance data. Additionally, different business domains may have a variety of other data sources that influence failure patterns which are not listed here exhaustively. These should be identified by consulting the domain experts when building predictive models.\n\nSome examples of above data elements from use cases are:\n    \n**Machine conditions and usage:** Flight routes and times, sensor data collected from aircraft engines, sensor readings from ATM transactions, train events data, sensor readings from wind turbines, elevators and connected cars.\n    \n**Machine features:** Circuit breaker technical specifications such as voltage levels, geolocation or car features such as make, model, engine size, tire types, production facility etc.\n\n**Failure history:** fight delay dates, aircraft component failure dates and types, ATM cash withdrawal transaction failures, train/elevator door failures, brake disk replacement order dates, wind turbine failure dates and circuit breaker command failures.\n\n**Maintenance history:** Flight error logs, ATM transaction error logs, train maintenance records including maintenance type, short description etc. and circuit breaker maintenance records.\n\nGiven the above data sources, the two main data types we observe in predictive maintenance domain are temporal data and static data. Failure history, machine conditions, repair history, usage history are time series indicated by the timestamp of data collection. Machine and operator specific features, are more static, since they usually describe the technical specifications of machines or operatorâ€™s properties.\n\nFor this scenario, we use a relatively large-scale data to walk you through the main steps from data ingestion (this Jupyter notebook), feature engineering, model building, and model operationalization and deployment. The code for the entire process is written in PySpark and implemented using Jupyter notebooks within Azure Databricks. We use Azure Databricks scheduled notebooks to simulate creating failure predictions in batch scenarios. \n\n# Step 1: Data Ingestion\n\nThis data aquisiton notebook will download the simulated predictive maintenance data sets from our GitHub data store. We do some preliminary data cleaning and store the results as a Spark data frame on the Azure Cluster for use in the remaining notebook steps of this analysis.\n\n**Note:** This notebook will take about 10-15 minutes to execute all cells, depending on the compute configuration you have setup.
