# Batch scoring of SPARK machine learning models 

## Overview

This scenario demonstrates batch scoring of a SPARK machine learning model on Azure Databricks. The model is constructed for a predictive maintenance scenario where we classify machine sensor readings into healthy or unhealthy and requiring maintenance for a set of four machine components. The resulting supervised multi-class model scores batches of new observations through a regularly scheduled Azure Databricks notebook tasks.

For this scenario, “Input Data” in the architecture diagram refers to a set of five simulated data sets related to realistic machine operating conditions. The solution uses methods from the PySpark MLlib machine learning library but the scoring process can be generalized to use any Python or R model hosted on Azure Databricks to make real-time predictions.

## Design

This solution uses the Azure Databricks service. We create jobs that set up the batch scoring demonstration. Each job executes a Databricks notebook to prepare the data and create the full solution.

 1. Ingest process downloads the simulated datasets from a GitHub site and converts and stores them as Spark dataframes on the Databricks DBFS.

 2. Feature engineering transorms and combines the data sets into an analysis dataset. The analysis data set can be targeted for training a model, or scoring data for a production pipeline. Each analysis dataset is also stored in the Databricks DBFS.

 3. Training process takes a subset of the complete data and constructs a model we can use to predict future outcomes. The model is stored in the Databricks DBFS for use by the scoring notebook.

 4. The scoring process uses a different subset of the data, including data not yet collected to predict the current and future state of the machine. The model results are stored back onto the Databricks DBFS.

# Prerequisites

We assume you have cloned the GitHub repository to your working compute instance (local computer or VM). The repository is located at: `https://github.com/Azure/BatchSparkScoringPredictiveMaintenance.git`

We will be using a Databricks command line utility (CLI) to automate many of these tasks. You should have a Python version installed. We require Python Version > 2.7.9 or > 3.6 for Databricks CLI requirements.

## Azure Databricks
This example is designed to run on Azure Databricks. You can provision the service through the Azure portal at:

https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Databricks

This particular example will run on the Standard pricing tier. 

## Databricks cluster

Once your Azure Databricks instance has been deployed, we can create a compute cluster. Launch your new workspace, select the *Clusters* icon. and Create a new cluster with Python Version 3.

## Databricks CLI

In order to avoid trying to explain how to execute the required steps in the Databricks UI, we will require the Databricks CLI available here:

https://github.com/databricks/databricks-cli

From a command line, you can pip install using 

`pip install --upgrade databricks-cli`

# Setup

## Connect the CLI

We need to connect the CLI to your databricks instance. This can be done using a Databricks generated [Authentication token](https://docs.databricks.com/api/latest/authentication.html#token-management).

Start from a command line, using the following command:

`databricks configure --token`

This will prompt you for your Azure Databricks hostname, which is the url portion of the web address from your browser. In eastus region, it will be `https://eastus.azuredatabricks.net/`. You will not use the POST arguments for the hostname (everything including and following the '?' character).

 You will also need an [Authentication token](https://docs.databricks.com/api/latest/authentication.html#token-management)

This operation will connect the CLI to this Databricks instance for all commands that follow.

## Import Notebooks

We next copy the scenario notebooks to the Databricks instance. We can do this with a single CLI command.

`databricks workspace import_dir [OPTIONS] SOURCE_PATH TARGET_PATH`

If you change into the local copy of the repository, your `SOURCE_PATH` will be the `notebooks` directory. The target path will include your user name, which you can get from the Azure Databricks UI, it should be related to your Azure AD email of the form `<uname@example.com>`. The `[TARGET_PATH]` will then be of the form `/Users/<uname@example.com>/notebooks`. 

The command should look like the following:

`databricks workspace import_dir notebooks /Users/<uname@example.com>/notebooks`

This will copy all required notebooks into the `notebooks` folder of your Azure Databricks Workspace.

## Get cluster Id

The final required piece of information is to find the cluster ID. We can only get this with the CLI with the following command:

`databricks clusters list`

The cluster ID is in the first field of the list. We will use this to point the Databricks Jobs to execute on a specific execute cluster.

## Custom Configuration

The solution is built using a series of notebooks that are executed using the Databricks Jobs construct. We can construct the Databricks Jobs using mouse clicks the Azure Databricks UI or through commands on the Databricks CLI. We've included script templates to create Databricks Jobs using the CLI. The `config.py` will customize these scripts to connect to your specific Azure Databricks instance. To connect, we need your username (`uname@example.com`) and the cluster ID (`clusterID`) found above.

From the root repository, the command usage would be:

```
python scripts/config.py [-h] [-c CLUSTERID] [-u USERNAME] ./jobs/
```

This command reads the `./jobs/*.tmpl` files, and replaces the clusterID and username placeholder strings with the specifics for your Databricks cluster, and stores the results in the JSON jobs scripts we'll use to setup the environment and demonstrate the Batch scoring processes.

# Steps

Before we can get to scoring a machine learning model, we need to go through the steps of a data science process. 

1. **Ingest the data**
1. **Transform and manipulate the data** into an analysis data set
1. **Create a model**
1. **Score** new observations with the created model

For this scenario, you could bring your own model, and skip the initial three steps of this scenario.

## Ingest data

The first step is to download the data and store as a Spark Dataframe on your Azure Databricks instance. The actual process is done through the `1_data_ingestion.ipynb` jupyter notebook that we copied into the `notebooks` folder of your workspace. You can either use the Azure Databricks UI to connect the notebook to your cluster and execute all cells, or use the CLI to create a Databricks Job to do the same process. We'll use the Job script we customized above.

To create a job from the CLI, use the following command:
`databricks jobs create --json-file jobs/01_CreateDataIngestion.json`

This registers the job, and describes what notebook to execute where. To run the job, take the job-id returned when the job was created, and use the following command:

`databricks jobs run-now --job-id <jobID>`

The first run may take some time, as it will need to startup the target cluster before running all cells in the data ingestion notebook. 

You can review the registered jobs in your Azure Databricks instance through the UI or with the CLI command 

`databricks jobs list`


## Transform and manipulate the data

`databricks jobs create --json-file jobs/02_CreateFeatureEngineering.json`

`databricks jobs run-now --job-id <jobID>`

We supply parameters using the `--notebook-params` command.

`databricks jobs run-now --job-id <jobID> --notebook-params {"FEATURES_TABLE":"testing_data","Start_Date":"2015-11-15","zEnd_Date":"2017-01-01"}`

On windows command line, we need to escape the double quotes:

`databricks jobs run-now --job-id <jobID> --notebook-params {\"FEATURES_TABLE\":\"testing_data\",\"Start_Date\":\"2015-11-15\",\"zEnd_Date\":\"2017-01-01\"}`

## Create a model

`databricks jobs create --json-file jobs/03_CreateModelBuilding.json`

`databricks jobs run-now --job-id <jobID>`

`databricks jobs run-now --job-id <jobID> --notebook-params {\"model\":\"DecisionTree\"}`

If you already have a SPARK model saved in Parquet format, you can copy using the CLI command `dbfs cp <SRC> <DST>`.

`dbfs cp  -r model.pqt dbfs:/storage/models/model.pqt`

## Score new observations

We need to create the data set we'll score using the Feature engineering job and a date range.

`databricks jobs run-now --job-id <jobID> --notebook-params {\"FEATURES_TABLE\":\"scoring_input\",\"Start_Date\":\"2015-12-30\",\"zEnd_Date\":\"2016-04-30\"}`

The load the scoring job

`databricks jobs create --json-file jobs/04_CreateModelScoring.json`

Then run the job.

`databricks jobs run-now --job-id <jobID>`
